    <h1>Find out what focus means and use an example of auto focus</h1>
    <p>
      Focus in web development refers to the state when an element, such as an
      input field, is ready to receive user input. When an element is focused,
      it is highlighted or activated, allowing users to interact with it
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auto focus is a feature that automatically sets the focus on a specific
      element when a web page loads. This is particularly useful for input
      fields where you want the user to start typing immediately without having
      to click on the field first.
    </p>
    <p>Example of autofocus:</p>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="autoFocusInput"
      placeholder="Start typing instantly"
      autofocus
    />
  </body>
